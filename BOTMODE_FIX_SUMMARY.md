# Bot Mode Manual & Force Mode Fix

## Problem Summary
The manual mode and force manual mode were not functioning because:

1. **Bot Mode Service was Disabled**: The `useBotModeWithTab` hook was commented out and replaced with a mock implementation
2. **Force Mode Toggle was Broken**: The force mode toggle was calling a mocked function that did nothing
3. **UI Elements were Hidden**: The mode indicator and toggle buttons were commented out
4. **Mode Change Handler was Simplified**: The manual mode change logic was removed

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Re-enabled Bot Mode Service
- ✅ Uncommented the `useBotModeWithTab` import
- ✅ Replaced the mock `botMode` object with actual hook implementation
- ✅ Added proper error handling to prevent infinite loops

### 2. Fixed Force Mode Toggle
- ✅ `toggleForceMode` function now calls the real `botMode.setForceMode()` method
- ✅ Added better error handling with user-friendly messages

### 3. Restored UI Elements
- ✅ Uncommented and enhanced the mode indicator display
- ✅ Added manual mode toggle button with visual feedback
- ✅ Added force mode toggle button (admin only)
- ✅ Added loading states and visual indicators

### 4. Implemented Mode Change Logic
- ✅ `handleModeChange` function now properly calls bot mode service methods
- ✅ Manual mode sets 30-minute timeout automatically
- ✅ Bot mode switch works correctly

### 5. Added Debug Tools
- ✅ Re-enabled BotModeDebugPanel for development
- ✅ Added Ctrl+Shift+D shortcut to toggle debug panel
- ✅ Debug panel shows cache stats and allows manual testing

## How to Test

### Testing Manual Mode
1. Open any pengaduan detail page (`/pengaduan/[sessionId]`)
2. Switch to "Pesan" tab
3. Look for the mode indicator in the top-right corner
4. Click "Manual Mode" button to enable manual mode (30 min timeout)
5. The indicator should show "Manual" with green background
6. You should see the message input field appear at the bottom
7. Click "Switch to Bot" to return to bot mode

### Testing Force Mode (Admin Only)
1. Login as admin user
2. Open any pengaduan detail page
3. Switch to "Pesan" tab  
4. Click "Force Mode" button (orange)
5. The indicator should show "FORCE" badge in red
6. Force mode prevents all automatic mode switching
7. Click "Disable Force" to turn off force mode

### Testing Debug Panel (Development Only)
1. Make sure `NODE_ENV=development`
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + D` on the pengaduan detail page
3. Debug panel appears in bottom-right corner
4. Shows current mode, cache stats, and allows manual testing
5. Can clear cache and manually switch modes

### Testing Automatic Mode Switching
1. With force mode OFF, switch between tabs:
   - **Pesan tab**: Should automatically enable manual mode (30 min)
   - **Tindakan tab**: Should automatically enable bot mode
2. With force mode ON:
   - Tab switching should NOT change modes
   - Mode stays locked until force mode is disabled

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /mode/{from}` - Get current mode and force status
- `PUT /mode/{from}` - Set bot mode
- `POST /mode/manual/{from}` - Set manual mode with timeout
- `POST /mode/force/{from}` - Toggle force mode

## Error Handling
- ✅ Network errors are logged but don't crash the UI
- ✅ Mode change failures show user-friendly alerts
- ✅ Cache misses fall back to API calls
- ✅ Force mode checks prevent invalid operations

## Performance Improvements
- ✅ Caching reduces redundant API calls
- ✅ Debouncing prevents multiple rapid requests
- ✅ Request cancellation prevents race conditions
- ✅ Circuit breaker pattern for failed endpoints

## Notes
- Manual mode has a 30-minute auto-expire timeout
- Force mode overrides all automatic switching
- Debug panel is only available in development mode
- Admin role required for force mode toggle
- All mode changes are cached for 30 seconds to improve performance

The manual mode and force mode should now work correctly!
